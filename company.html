            <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. RADOSLAV DANILAK, CO-FOUNDER and CEO</h2>

<p>
"Rado" Danilak has over 25 years of industry experience and over 100 patents designing 
state-of-the-art processing systems. In 2016 he founded Tachyum to disrupt markets by 
solving the processing performance plateau of nanometer class chips.

</p><p>

Rado was founder and CEO of Skyera, a supplier of ultra-dense solid-state storage systems, 
acquired by WD in 2014. As CEO he won the 2013 Gold Tech Awards Circle for Emerging Company 
Executive of the Year. At Wave Computing, Rado architected the 10GHz Processing Element of deep learning DPU.

</p><p>

Rado was cofounder and CTO of SandForce acquired by LSI in 2011 for $377M. Rado pioneered enterprise and 
consumer MLC flash controllers and solved endurance limited by device physics.  He was a chipset and GPU architect 
at nVidia, a CPU architect at Nishan Systems and Toshiba, and chief architect of 64b x86 CPU at Gizmo Tech.

</p><p>

The Microprocessor Report said Rado "has developed some interesting ideas that show significant promise 
in delivering performance better than that of the leading processors expected in near future... these ideas 
are likely to appear in other next-generation instruction sets, including the HP/Intel IA-64."

</p><p>

Dr. Danilak is U.S. citizen born in Slovakia, and serves on the Slovak government's Innovation Advisory 
Board. He holds a Ph.D in Computer Science and an MS in Electrical Engineering from the TUKE Slovakia, where 
he taught compiler courses.

<p>

	Rod has over 30 years experience designing advanced networking and storage processing chips and systems. 
	He holds 28 patents and has a strong track record designing complex storage and networking chips and systems.
	Rod was cofounder of Skyera where he architected and implemented ASIC and FPGA-based flash controllers for two All-Flash enterprise-grade storage systems.
	
</p><p>
 

	Rod was chief hardware architect at SandForce, which was acquired by LSI in 2011.  He wrote the hardware architecture and micro architecture 
	documents for the company’s first 2 chips, which solved a major Flash endurance limitation, caused by the device physics of multi-level flash memory cells.

</p><p>

	Rod was a cofounder of Nishan Systems, which developed Storage over IP switches which allowed Fibre Channel traffic to be transported over Ethernet 
	and IP networks. His design experience includes hardware compression, FC and GE MAC, Hypertransport, DDR controllers, frame parsers and generators, 
	and TCP/IP offload hardware.  He co-architected a Storage Area Network switch/router which supported Fibre Channel, Gigabit Ethernet, iFCP, and iSCSI interfaces.  	

</p><p>

	At Sandia National Labs, Rod worked on the design of the Trident II warhead telemetry. He designed the logic for 3 gate arrays 
	and a radiation hardened chip. He directed a team of engineers in hardware design for 2 classified projects.  His duties included generation of 
	design specifications, test plans, and presentations to the Department of Energy.	
	
</p><p>

	Rod is a U.S. citizen and holds Masters and Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degrees from the University of Wisconsin.

<p>

Igor brings over 20 years of expertise in compilers, system software and tools development.

</p><p>

At Skyera, he worked on performance optimization of the flash-translation layer of Skyera’s storage systems. 
Following Skyera’s acquisition Igor remained at HGST to help to integrate the new technology into their product line. 
Prior to Skyera, Igor led compiler and system tools development at MicroUnity, which designed a broadband microprocessor BroadMX. 
MicroUnity’s innovations in SIMD processing were licensed by all microprocessor industry leaders. 
Before that, he was a part of WindRiver’s GCC compiler and GNU toolchain team, working on code generation for several processor architectures.
</p><p>

In Russia, Igor led system tools development teams on projects contracted by Nortel Networks, Information Satellite Systems and other clients. 
As one of the founders of Excelsior's JET project, Igor had spearheaded the development of the AOT Java compiler, which continues to sell 20 years after its launch.
