			<h4>
				Tachyum Launches to Break Performance and Cost Barriers to 
				Intelligent Information Processing
			</h4>

			<p>
				CAMPBELL, Calif., February 8, 2017 – Silicon Valley startup Tachyum Inc. launched today, 
				announcing its mission to conquer the performance plateau in nanometer-class chips and the systems they power.
			</p><p>

				Based on new proprietary computational mechanisms, created specifically to unlock the performance of 
				nanometer-size devices, Tachyum will deliver solutions with unprecedented speed, power, and cost to 
				solve the most complex problems in the cloud, big data, deep learning, mobile devices, autonomous systems, 
				and large-scale computing. The impact of Tachyum products will be felt across a broad spectrum 
				of applications and markets.
				
			</p><p>

				Tachyum was cofounded by Dr. Radoslav “Rado” Danilak, who has spent more than 25 years designing state-of-the-art 
				processing systems and delivering technically inspired, economically significant products to market. Holding more 
				than 100 patents, Rado pioneered enterprise and consumer MLC flash adoption, with a Flash Memory Controller that 
				increased Flash endurance (limited by device physics) by 10X.
				
			</p><p>

				Dr. Danilak was founder and CEO of Skyera, a supplier of ultra-dense solid-state storage systems, acquired 
				by WD in 2014. At Wave Computing, he architected the 10GHz Processing Element of their deep learning DPU. 
				He was cofounder and CTO of SandForce, acquired by LSI in 2011 for $377 million; a chipset and GPU architect 
				at nVidia; a CPU architect at Nishan Systems and Toshiba; and chief architect of 64b x86 CPU at Gizmo Tech. 
				
			</p><p>
				
				“We have entered a post-Moore’s Law era where performance hit a plateau, cost reduction slowed dramatically, 
				and process node shrinks and CPU release cycles are getting longer,” said Danilak, Tachyum CEO. “An innovative new 
				approach, from first principles is the only realistic chance we have of achieving performance improvements to rival 
				those that powered the tech industry of past decades, and the opportunity is a hundred times 
				greater than any venture I’ve been involved in.” 
			
			</p><p>

				Tachyum is also cofounded by Ken Wagner, with more than 25 years of relevant experience: Ken was a cofounder 
				of machine learning company Wave Computing, chip synthesis tools company Silicon Analytics, and Theseus Logic, 
				a clock-less logic company that invented patented Null Convention Logic (NCL).

			</p><p>

				As vice president of software engineering, cofounder Igor Shevlyakov brings more than 20 years of compiler experience 
				to Tachyum as a core competency. At Skyera he led the performance aspects of the flash-translation layer, and led compiler 
				and system tools development at MicroUnity, which designed BroadMX CPU and licensed its innovations in SIMD processing to
				microprocessor industry leaders. Before that, Igor was part of WindRiver's GCC compiler and GNU toolchain team, working on 
				code generation for several processor architectures. As one of the founders of Excelsior's JET, Igor spearheaded the 
				development of the AOT Java compiler.
				
			</p><p>

				Cofounder and chief hardware architect Rod Mullendore brings a unique set of critical hardware skills to Tachyum, 
				along with his 30 years’ experience designing extremely complex storage and networking chips and systems. Rod architected 
				and implemented ASIC and FPGA-based flash controllers at Skyera. He was chief architect for the flash controller chips at 
				SandForce, and he was a member of the founding team of Nishan Systems, which developed Storage over IP adapted for 
				the IETF iFCP RFC4172.

				<h5> About Tachyum </h5>
			
			<p>

				Named for the Greek “tachy,” meaning speed, combined with “-um,” indicating an element, Tachyum emerged from stealth mode 
				in 2017 dedicated to engineering disruptive intelligent information processing products. Tachyum’s founders have a 
				track record of solving problems caused by device physics to deliver transformational products to market. 
				The Campbell, Calif.-based company received seed funding in 2016.
